Hi! I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Statistics Department at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Dr. Xianyang Zhang. Before starting my doctoral journey, I received a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2017. I also spent two years in a joint Ph.D. program between Texas A&M and the Institute of Statistics and Big Data at Renmin University of China.
